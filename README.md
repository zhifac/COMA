## Description
COMA CE is the community edition of the well-established COMA project developed at the University of Leipzig(http://dbs.uni-leipzig.de/Research/coma.html). It comprises the parsers, matcher library, matching framework and a sample GUI for tests and evaluations. 

COMA was initiated at the database chair of the University of Leipzig in 2002 and got much positive feedback ever since. It excels due to numerous matching strategies, which can be combined to large matching workflows, and which enable reliable match results between different kind of schemas.
